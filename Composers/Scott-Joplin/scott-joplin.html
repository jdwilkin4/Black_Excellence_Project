                        Joplin was the second of six children born to Giles Joplin, a former slave from North Carolina, and Florence Givens, a freeborn African-American woman from Kentucky.
                        By 1880 the Joplins moved to Texarkana, Arkansas where Giles worked as a railroad laborer and Florence as a cleaner. As Joplin's father had played the violin for plantation parties in North Carolina and his mother sang and played the banjo, 
                        he was given a rudimentary musical education by his family and from the age of seven he was allowed to play the piano while his mother cleaned. According to a family friend, the young Joplin was serious and ambitious studying music and playing 
                        the piano after school. While a few local teachers aided him, he received most of his musical education from Julius Weiss, a German-born American Jewish music professor.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        In the late 1880s, having performed at various local events as a teenager, Joplin gave up his job as a railroad laborer and left Texarkana to become a traveling musician. 
                        Churches and brothels were among the few options for steady work. Joplin played pre-ragtime "jig-piano" in various red-light districts throughout the mid-South, 
                        and some claim he was in Sedalia and St. Louis, Missouri, during this time.In 1893, while in Chicago for the World's Fair, Joplin formed a band in which he played cornet 
                        and also arranged the band's music. Although the World's Fair minimized the involvement of African-Americans, black performers still came to the saloons, cafés and brothels that lined the fair.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        In 1894 Joplin arrived in Sedalia, Missouri. He performed in the Queen City Cornet Band and his own six-piece dance orchestra. A tour with his own singing group, the Texas Medley Quartet, 
                        gave him his first opportunity to publish his own compositions, and it is known that he went to Syracuse, New York and Texas. Two businessmen from New York published Joplin's first two works, 
                        the songs "Please Say You Will" and "A Picture of Her Face", in 1895. Joplin's visit to Temple, Texas enabled him to have three pieces published there in 1896, including the "Great Crush Collision March”.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        Scott Joplin signed a contract on August 10, 1899 with John Stillwell Stark, to publish Maple Leaf Rag. The contract stipulated that Joplin would receive a 1% royalty on all sales of the Maple Leaf Rag, 
                        with a minimum sales price of 25 cents. With the inscription "To the Maple Leaf Club" prominently visible along the top of at least some editions, it is likely that the rag was named after the Maple Leaf Club. 
                        The "Maple Leaf Rag" did serve as a model for the hundreds of rags to come from future composers, especially in the development of classic ragtime. After the publication of the "Maple Leaf Rag", 
                        Joplin was soon being described as "King of rag time writers".

                        After Scott Joplin and his wife Belle moved to St. Louis in early 1900, they had a baby daughter who died only a few months after birth. 
                        Joplin's relationship with his wife was difficult, as she had no interest in music. They eventually separated and then divorced. In June 1904, Joplin married 
                        Freddie Alexander of Little Rock, Arkansas, the young woman to whom he had dedicated "The Chrysanthemum". She died on September 10, 1904, of complications resulting from a cold, 
                        ten weeks after their wedding.

                <h2 class="main-title">Joplin’s Opera Company</h2>
                <div class="bio-sections">
                    <p class="section-styles">
                        In the early 1900’s, Joplin created an opera company of 30 people and produced his first opera A Guest of Honor for a national tour. It is not certain how many productions were staged, 
                        or even if this was an all-black show or a racially mixed production. During the tour, either in Springfield, Illinois, or Pittsburg, Kansas, 
                        someone associated with the company stole the box office receipts. Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. 
                        It is believed that the score for A Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City, which he believed was the best place to find a producer for a new opera. After his move to New York, Joplin met Lottie Stokes, 
                        whom he married in 1909. In 1911, unable to find a publisher, Joplin undertook the financial burden of self publishing his opera called Treemonisha in a piano-vocal format. 
                        In 1915, as a last-ditch effort to see it performed, he invited a small audience to hear it at a rehearsal hall in Harlem. Poorly staged and with only Joplin on piano accompaniment, 
                        it was "a miserable failure" to a public not ready for "crude" black musical forms—so different from the European grand opera of that time. The audience, including potential backers, was indifferent and walked out.

                        By 1916, Joplin was suffering from tertiary syphilis but more specifically it likely was neurosyphilis. In January 1917, he was admitted to Manhattan State Hospital,
                        a mental institution. He died there on April 1 of syphilitic dementia at the age of 48 and was buried in a pauper's grave that remained unmarked for 57 years. 
                        His grave at St. Michael's Cemetery in East Elmhurst was finally given a marker in 1974, the year The Sting, which showcased his music, won for Best Picture at the Oscars.
