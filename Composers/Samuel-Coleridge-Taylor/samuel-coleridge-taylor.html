                        Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was born in London in 1875. 
                        His mother, Alice Hare Martin, was British and his father, Dr Daniel Taylor, 
                        hailed from Freetown in Sierra Leone. Dr Taylor met Alice in London, but appears to have returned to West Africa without 
                        knowing that she was pregnant. The young Coleridge-Taylor was raised by Alice and her family in Croydon, on the outskirts of London. 
                        In the 1880s Samuel was given his first violin by his Grandfather, who also taught him how to play. Samuel fell in love with music, 
                        and was noticed by a wealthy choirmaster who encouraged him to apply for a place at the Royal College of Music in South Kensington.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Samuel Coleridge-Taylor joined the Royal College of Music in 1890. He was one of the first black students at the College. 
                        Samuel was awarded a scholarship for the violin however; he was soon drawn towards composition instead. He went on to study under the 
                        composer and conductor Charles Villiers Stanford. Several of the young composer's works were performed at the College, and he soon gained attention 
                        from prominent musical figures - including George Grove.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        The first evidence of Samuel's involvement in black political issues was a poem he wrote celebrating a half-century of Liberian independence from European colonialists. 
                        A Liberian Patriotic Hymn was published in the African Times in March 1897. It included the opening lines: "Beloved Liberians! Now from Bondage free/May ‘God our Strength’ your 
                        Motto and your hope for ever be!" Documents held at the Royal College of Music Museum reveal that Coleridge-Taylor was later made a Knight Official of the Liberian Humane Order of African Redemption. 
                        This is the highest decoration the Liberian government can bestow.

                <div class="bio-sections">
                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Samuel Coleridge-Taylor first met famed poet Paul Lawrence Dunbar when he heard that Dunbar was in London. Samuel went to the house where he was staying and asked for permission to set some of his poems to music. 
                        Dunbar agreed, and Coleridge-Taylor’s African Romances were published later the same year. In June of 1897, Coleridge-Taylor and Dunbar gave a joint recital in London, attended by many influential American expats.

                <h2 class="main-title">Song of Hiawatha</h2>
                <div class="bio-sections">
                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Samuel Coleridge-Taylor would become best known for his trilogy of cantatas, collectively known as The Song of Hiawatha. These were based on Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s famous poem of the same name (published in 1855) 
                        which relates the adventures of a Native American hero called Hiawatha and his love Minnehaha. Coleridge-Taylor much admired Longfellow’s Hiawatha and felt a close affinity with its hero. Perhaps this was because Hiawatha spends 
                        part of the poem searching for his absent father who had abandoned his mother – much like Coleridge-Taylor’s own father had done.

                        Samuel married a woman named Jessie who was a pianist that studied at the Royal College of Music. 
                        Her family had initially objected to her marriage on account of Coleridge-Taylor’s mixed race. The couple went on to have two children(a daughter Gwendolyn and son Hiawatha).

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        The Song of Hiawatha proved to be a huge success. Coleridge-Taylor soon became a celebrity. Hiawatha was performed by choral societies across the country, often conducted by Coleridge-Taylor himself. 
                        Copies of sheet music for various arrangements were sold widely, though the composer profited little from these sales.

                <div class="bio-sections">
                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        In 1905, Coleridge-Taylor’s Twenty Four Negro Melodies were published. This collection of African and African American songs were presented by the composer as a collection of folk music. 
                        In the introduction to this work he boldly stated his aim: “What Brahms has done for the Hungarian folk-music, Dvořák for the Bohemian, and Grieg for the Norwegian, I have tried to do for Negro melodies.”

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        In America, Coleridge-Taylor’s reputation was much strengthened by the support of (white) virtuoso violinist Maud Powell. One of the first great artists of the recording era, Powell 
                        recorded a version of Coleridge-Taylor’s ‘Deep River’ from Twenty-Four Negro Melodies. This would become exceptionally popular – she later described it as her best-selling recording. Maud Powell was an ardent 
                        supporter of African American music, and performed to raise funds for the education of black musicians.

                <div class="bio-sections">
                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        In 1912 Coleridge-Taylor died suddenly and unexpectedly. He became ill whilst on a train, and died of pneumonia a few days later. There was a national outpouring of grief at his death. 
                        Huge crowds attended Coleridge-Taylor’s funeral in South London. In 1912 a memorial concert was held for Coleridge-Taylor at the Royal Albert Hall, with proceeds going to his young family. 
                        Many were appalled at the way in which Coleridge-Taylor had profited little from the extraordinary success of his works, leaving meager funds behind him. This outrage led to the establishment of the Performing Rights Society.
