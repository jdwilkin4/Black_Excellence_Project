                        Harry Thacker Burleigh was born on December 2, 1866, in Erie, Pennsylvania. His mother, Elizabeth, was a domestic worker because she was unable to get a teaching position despite her college education and fluency in French and Greek. 
                        When Harry was a child his grandfather would sing plantation songs to him, thus passing on the music of the Negro spiritual–that Harry would one day make known around the world. 
                        Burleigh’s mother, who he credited as his strongest supporter, recognized his strong desire for music. Into young adulthood, Burleigh took several jobs as a laborer to help support his family. Music, however, was his steady companion. 
                        He sang while at work, and he took advantage of any opportunity to hear musicians who came to town. He sang at school and in the choirs at St. Paul’s and Park Presbyterian churches and the Reform Jewish Temple. 
                        After graduating from high school in 1887, Burleigh continued to improve his skills as a musician while he was employed as a stenographer for two area businesses.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        In 1892, at the age of 26, Burleigh heard that the National Conservatory of Music was holding auditions for a scholarship. Burleigh journeyed to New York, departing Erie with only $30, which he had acquired through gifts and loans. 
                        The adjudicators at his audition concluded that he fell just below the standards required to receive the scholarship. However, Frances MacDowell, the school’s registrar intervened, and Burleigh eventually received a scholarship. 
                        The subjects that Burleigh studied at the conservatory included voice with Christian Fritsch, harmony with Rubin Goldmark, and counterpoint with John White and Max Spicker. 
                        He also played in the orchestra and was its librarian. Because his scholarship only covered his tuition, he also had to work just to survive. 
                        Among the contacts that Burleigh made during his years at the conservatory were composer Edward MacDowell, son of Burleigh’s benefactor, and composer/conductor Victor Herbert. 
                        However, it was his association with Czech composer Antonin Dvořák that most strongly influenced Burleigh’s career as a composer.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Burleigh spent many evenings singing the spirituals of his youth for Dvořák. 
                        He also did manuscript copying for the composer. In January 1894, Burleigh, along with soprano Sissieretta Jones, were the featured soloists in Dvořák’s arrangement of “Old Folks at Home,” 
                        presented in New York’s Madison Square Garden. In 1894 Burleigh auditioned for the baritone soloist position at St. George’s Episcopal Church of New York. 
                        Although there was much debate about hiring a Negro to sing in the affluent parish, he was selected for the post over numerous other applicants. 
                        The beginning of this 52-year relationship marked the first time that Burleigh’s income allowed him to concentrate on his studies. 
                        He made several influential contacts, including entrepreneur J. Pierpont Morgan, who arranged additional engagements for Burleigh.

                        The next six years were very busy for Burleigh, both professionally and personally. In addition to his work as a singer, he completed his studies at the conservatory in 1896 and taught sight-singing there from 1895 until 1898. 
                        He married poet Louise Alston in 1898; their son, Alston, was born the following year. This was also the year that three of Burleigh’s early songs, on texts by his wife, were first published by G. Schirmer. 
                        In 1900, he became an editor for G. Ricordi, and he was selected as the first African-American to serve as soloist for Temple Emanu-El, an affluent New York synagogue. 
                        Burleigh continued and expanded his contacts with the Black musical and academic community. He had two brief brushes with vaudeville. 
                        He was a guest lecturer and performer at Black colleges and universities. He became acquainted with celebrated personalities such as composers Will Marion Cook, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, and Robert Nathaniel Dett, 
                        and academicians Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. DuBois.

                        By 1916, Burleigh had published several works, most of them being art songs. Most notable amongst these were “Ethiopia Saluting the Colors” (1915), 
                        and Five Songs by Laurence Hope (1915). He also wrote a few vocal and instrumental works based on the plantation melodies he had learned as a child. However, his 1916 setting of the spiritual, 
                        “Deep River,” is considered one of the earliest examples of concert spirituals–songs written in art song form specifically for performance by a trained singer. 
                        “Deep River,” and other spiritual settings became very popular to concert performers and recording artists, both black and white. It was soon normal for recitals to end with a group of spirituals. 
                        Musicians such as Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson and Paul Robeson made these songs a part of their repertoires.

                        In 1946, illness forced Burleigh to retire as a soloist. His son, Alston, and daughter-in-law placed him in a Long Island rest home a few months later. 
                        Then, concerned about his father’s health, Alston Burleigh moved his father to a nursing home in Stamford, Connecticut, in 1948. On September 12, 1949, Harry Burleigh died of heart failure at the age of 82. 
                        His funeral was held at St. George’s and was attended by 2,000 mourners. Some of his choral and solo settings were sung during the service, and the pall bearers included composers Hall Johnson, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, William C. Handy, and Cameron White.
