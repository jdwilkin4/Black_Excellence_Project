                        Margaret Jeanette Allison Majors was born on March 3, 1913, in Chicago, Illinois. 
                        Her father, Monroe Majors, was a physician, lecturer, and author who was also politically active. 
                        Her mother, Estella Bonds, was a trained musician who taught piano and served as church choral director and organist. 
                        When her parents’ troubled marriage ended in 1917, Margaret’s last name was changed to Bonds.

                        Margaret Bonds began studying piano with her mother at a very early age. 
                        By the time she was eight, she had progressed to studying at the Coleridge-Taylor Music School where her mother and Tom Theodore Taylor served on the faculty.  
                        In 1926, Bonds started studying composition with Chicago newcomers William Dawson and Florence Price (with whom she also studied piano).  
                        Bonds was also a charter member of the Junior Music Division of the National Association of Negro Musicians.

                        In 1929, she was admitted to Northwestern University.  She studied piano with Emily Boettiche Bogue and composition with Arnie Oldburg and Dean Carl Beecher. 
                        While at Northwestern, she was allowed to study but not allowed to live in or use their facilities.

                        Three years into her studies, in 1932, her composition “Sea Ghost,” won the prestigious Wanamaker award. 
                        Her teacher Florence Price had also received two wanamaker awards for her symphony no.1 and piano sonata. 
                        That same year, she became the first African American to perform with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and she was the featured pianist for 
                        the Woman’s Symphony Orchestra of Chicago’s performance of Price’s Piano Concerto in D Minor.

                        In 1933, Bonds had completed her Bachelors in Music and received the Rosenwald Scholarship for graduate study at Northwestern. 
                        Upon graduation, Margaret Bonds worked in Chicago performing, composing and collaborating with writer and poet, Langston Hughes.  
                        She met Hughes in 1936 and toured in Wisconsin and Iowa with singer Katherine Van Buren, while studying orchestration with Albert Nölte. 
                        Bonds also attempted to start the Allied Arts Academy, which aimed at providing musical education for black youth in Chicago.  
                        Unfortunately this proved to be an unsuccessful venture, and so Margaret had decided to relocate to New York in 1939. 
                        In 1940, Bonds married a probation officer named Lawrence Richardson and would later have a daughter.

                        Within a year of her arrival, she had become actively involved in the musical theater life, both as a composer and pianist. 
                        Bonds also studied composition privately with famed composer Roy Harris and piano with Djane Herz at Julliard. 
                        In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, Bonds toured both as part of a piano duo and as a soloist performing a variety of classical and contemporary works. 
                        One of her most recorded compositions from this period is “Troubled Water”.

                        Maya Angelou describes Troubled Water as one of Margaret Bonds' masterpieces. This beautifully crafted work states the refrain and verse of the spiritual in various guises. 
                        The broad sweeping melody is initially spiced up by complex rhythmic accompaniments and harmonized with elements of the blues and jazz. It is then restated in a more languid tempo, 
                        beautifully embellished in the gospel tradition of piano performance. This work becomes increasingly more driven, building up to a grand climax with the juxtaposition of the two parts of the refrain Wade in the Water and God's gonna trouble the water.

                        During the 1950’s, Bonds composed a number of works using the poems of Langston Hughes–whom she had become close friends with over the years. 
                        The song cycles from this period include, Songs of the Seasons and Three Dream Portraits, as well as music for the Hughes play, Shakespeare in Harlem. 
                        The debut of her Christmas cantata, Ballad of the Brown King, which again used words by Hughes, was televised by CBS in December 1960. Commissions continued to come her way, 
                        including requests from singers Leontyne Price and Betty Allen. One of Bonds’ most well known settings was “He’s Got the Whole World in His Hand,” composed for Price in 1963.

                        When Langston Hughes died in 1967, Bonds suddenly decided to move to Los Angeles, leaving behind Lawrence Richardson, her husband of 27 years, and their 21-year-old daughter. 
                        She worked with the Los Angeles Inner City Cultural Center and Repertory Theater, and she offered music instruction to community youths in the basement of the center.

                        Despite her many professional successes, the personal tragedies in her life–especially the deaths of her mother in 1957 and Hughes ten years later–profoundly affected Bonds. 
                        She relied on alcohol more and more to cope with bouts of depression. Acquaintances of the composer believed that this was a direct cause of the heart attack that killed Bonds on April 26, 1972. 
                        A month after her death, Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic premiered her Credo for chorus and orchestra in 1972.
