                        Herbie Hancock was born in Chicago, the son of Winnie Belle and Wayman Edward Hancock. His parents named him after the singer and actor Herb Jeffries. 
                        He studied from age seven, and his talent was recognized early. He played the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 (Coronation) at a young 
                        people's concert on February 5, 1952, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (led by CSO assistant conductor George Schick) at the age of 11. Through his teens, Hancock never had a 
                        jazz teacher however he developed his ear and sense of harmony. In 1960, he heard Chris Anderson play just once and begged him to accept him as a student.

                        Hancock left Grinnell College, moved to Chicago, and began working with Donald Byrd and Coleman Hawkins. 
                        During this time he also took courses at Roosevelt University (later graduating from Grinnell with degrees in electrical engineering and music). 
                        Grinnell also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1972. Byrd was attending the Manhattan School of Music in New York at the time and suggested 
                        that Hancock study composition with Vittorio Giannini (which he did for a short time in 1960). The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with 
                        Oliver Nelson and Phil Woods.

                        He recorded his first solo album Takin' Off for Blue Note Records in 1962. "Watermelon Man" (from Takin' Off) was to provide Mongo Santamaría with a hit single, 
                        but more importantly for Hancock, Takin' Off caught the attention of Miles Davis, who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer Tony Williams, 
                        a member of the new band.

                        Hancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963, he joined Davis's Second Great Quintet. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. 
                        The rhythm section Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist Ron Carter, 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles.
                        While in Davis's band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a sideman with other musicians such as Shorter, Williams, Grant Green, Bobby Hutcherson, 
                        Rivers, Byrd, Kenny Dorham, Hank Mobley, Lee Morgan, Freddie Hubbard, and Eric Dolphy.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        During this period, Hancock also composed the score to Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blowup (1966), the first of many film soundtracks he recorded in his career. As well as feature film soundtracks, 
                        Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then well known products as Pillsbury's Space Food Sticks, Standard Oil, Tab diet cola and Virginia Slims cigarettes. 
                        Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of F. William Free commercials for Silva Thins cigarettes. Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him. 
                        He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track "He Who Lives in Fear" from his The Prisoner album of 1969.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        Davis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock's tenure with the Miles Davis band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric 
                        keyboards including the Fender Rhodes electric piano at Davis's insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be important in his future artistic endeavors.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        Hancock was dismissed from Davis's band and in the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet. After leaving Davis, Herbie put together a new band called The Headhunters and, in 1973, recorded ‘Head Hunters.’ 
                        With its crossover hit single “Chameleon,” it became the first jazz album to go platinum.  By mid-decade, Herbie was playing for stadium-sized crowds all over the world and had no fewer than four albums in the 
                        pop charts at once. In total, Herbie had 11 albums in the pop charts during the 1970s. His ’70s output inspired and provided samples for generations of hip-hop and dance music artists.   
                        Herbie also stayed close to his love of acoustic jazz in the ’70s, recording and performing with VSOP (reuniting him with his Miles Davis colleagues), and in duet settings with Chick Corea and Oscar Peterson.

                    <p class="section-styles">
                        In 1980, Herbie introduced the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis to the world as a solo artist, producing his debut album and touring with him as well. In 1983, a new pull to the alternative side led Herbie to a series of 
                        collaborations with Bill Laswell. The first, ‘Future Shock’, again struck platinum, and the single “Rockit” rocked the dance and R&B charts, winning a Grammy for Best R&B Instrumental. The video of the track won five MTV awards. 
                        ‘Sound System’, the follow-up, also received a Grammy in the R&B instrumental category. Herbie won an Oscar in 1986 for scoring the film “‘Round Midnight”, in which he also appeared as an actor. Numerous television appearances 
                        over the years led to two hosting assignments in the 1980s: “Rock School” on PBS and Showtime’s “Coast To Coast”. After an adventurous 1994 project for Mercury Records, ‘Dis Is Da Drum’, he moved to the Verve label, 
                        forming an all-star band to record 1996’s Grammy-winning ‘The New Standard’. In 1997, an album of duets with Wayne Shorter, ‘1+1’, was released.

                        Herbie reunited with Bill Laswell to collaborate with some young hip-hop and techno artists on 2001’s FUTURE2FUTURE. He also joined with Roy Hargrove and Michael Brecker in 2002 to record a live concert album, ‘Directions 
                        In Music: Live at Massey Hall’, a tribute to John Coltrane and Miles Davis. ‘Possibilities’, released in August 2005, teamed Herbie with many popular artists, such as Sting, Annie Lennox, John Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, 
                        Carlos Santana, Joss Stone and Damien Rice. That year, he played a number of concert dates with a re-staffed Headhunters, and became the first-ever Artist-In-Residence at the Tennessee-based festival Bonnaroo. In 2007, Hancock 
                        recorded and released ‘River: The Joni Letters’, a tribute to longtime friend and collaborator Joni Mitchell featuring Wayne Shorter, guitarist Lionel Loueke, bassist Dave Holland and drummer.

                        Hancock has a 50-year-plus marriage to Gigi Hancock, who he married August 31, 1968. Herbie and Gigi have a daughter, Jessica.  Since 1972, Hancock has practiced Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International. 
                        As part of Hancock's spiritual practice, he recites the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo each day. In 2013, Hancock's dialogue with musician Wayne Shorter and Soka Gakkai International president Daisaku Ikeda on jazz, Buddhism and life was published in Japanese and English.
