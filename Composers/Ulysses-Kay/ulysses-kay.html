                        Ulysses Simpson Kay, Jr. was an African American composer, conductor and professor.  
                        He was born on January 7, 1917 in Tucson, Arizona. His father, Ulysses Simpson Kay Sr., had been a Texas cowboy and barber. 
                        His mother, Elizabeth Kay, had come from Louisiana.  Both parents enjoyed music making at home and church. 
                        His step-brother played violin and saxophone, and his step-sister was a piano student. When he was six, his uncle, 
                        King Oliver urged to study piano, so he began studying with William A. Ferguson. At age 10 he began studying the violin, and, when he was 12, 
                        the alto saxophone. He soon organized a quintet with friends who played clarinet, trumpet, violin, and drums, for which ensemble he began 
                        composing and arranging, doing his best to aim for the sounds he heard as an avid radio listener to the broadcasts of Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, 
                        and Benny Goodman.  In school, he sang in the glee club and played in the marching and jazz bands.

                        Ulysses was encouraged to follow his musical interests by William Grant Still, whom he met in 1936 while completing his undergraduate studies 
                        at the University of Arizona. He had entered the school as a liberal arts major, but changed to a music education major before earning his B.M. degree in 1938. 
                        He encountered the music of Béla Bartók through his piano studies, and other contemporary music in his studies in theory with John L. Lowell.

                        He entered the Eastman School of Music on a scholarship in 1938, and studied with Bernard Rogers and Howard Hanson, securing his M.M. degree in 1940.  
                        Friendships from the Eastman days were formed with voice students Irma Allen, Raymond Morris, Kenneth Spencer, and William Warfield, and composers Mark Fax and Thomas Kerr. 
                        During these days he also came to know Jimmy Rushing and members of Count Basie’s band. At the Berkshire Festival in 1941 on scholarship, he won the attention of Paul Hindemith, 
                        and continued working with him at Yale University for the next school year. With the outbreak of World War II, Kay enlisted in the Navy in 1942 and was stationed with the band in Rhode Island, 
                        in which he played alto saxophone, flute, piccolo, and piano, active also in composing and arranging. He was granted an honorable discharge in 1946. 
                        Ulysses Kay studied at Columbia University in 1947 and spent summers at the Yaddo Festival, in Saratoga Springs NY.

                        Kay moved to Rome in 1949, armed with several grants including the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship (1947), National Institute of Arts and Letters (1947), the Prix de Rome (1949 and 1951) 
                        a Fulbright Scholarship (1949), and the Gershwin Memorial Award for his piece titled A short overture  (1950). In 1949, Ulysses married Barbara Harrison, who joined him in his residence in Italy, 
                        where she taught music at the Anglo-American Overseas School. Their daughter, Virginia, was born in Rome in 1951.  Their second child was Melinda, born in 1957, followed by Hillary in 1959.  
                        Ulysses returned to the united states in 1953 and was named advisor for the Broadcast Music, Inc.  In the summer of 1965, he was a visiting professor at Boston University, and later was named Distinguished 
                        Professor of Music in 1972 at the Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Over his lifetime, Ulysses Kay composed approximately 140 musical compositions for orchestra, chorus, chamber ensembles, piano, voice, organ, and band. 
                        He also wrote five operas as well as scores for film and television.  Kay’s works appear in numerous published editions and on approximately 21 recordings. 
                        His early period encompasses the years 1939–46 and includes such works as the ballet Danse Calinda (1941) and the Four Pieces for Male Chorus (1941).  
                        As a young composer, Kay experienced his first major success in Of New Horizons: Overture (1944), a piece premiered by the New York Philharmonic and 
                        awarded an American Broadcasting Company prize. Other works from this period include the Brief Elegy for oboe and string orchestra (1946), 
                        the Four Inventions for piano (1946) and A Short Overture (1946). Kay’s middle period, 1947–65, begins with the Suite for Strings (1947), 
                        which was premiered by the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra. The composer’s late period (1966–95) consisted of three operas: The Capitoline Venus (1969), 
                        Jubilee (1974–76), and Frederick Douglass (1979–85).
