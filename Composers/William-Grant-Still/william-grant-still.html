                        He studied at Oberlin with Maurice P. Kessler (violin), George Whitfield Andrews (composition), Friedrich J. Lehman (counterpoint and theory),

                        Black sailors were restricted to aspects of food service but, when it became known that Still was a trained musician, he was engaged to play the violin for the meals of officers on the U.S.S. Kroonland.  
                        Released from the Navy with the end of the war, he returned briefly to Oberlin and then in 1919 moved to New York, and worked with W.C. Handy as performer, arranger, and road manager and in Pace and Handy Music Company Band.

                        The show featured an African American cast and was so successful that it ran for 504 performances in New York City before going on tour.  Still's studies with the composer George Chadwick were without charge.  
                        They took place at the New England Conservatory of Music, where Chadwick was Director, beginning in 1921.  A scholarship enabled him to study composition with the avant garde composer Edgar Varese in New York City for two years.

                        The "Harlem Renaissance", also called the "New Negro Movement", began about the time of Still's arrival in New York City, and continued into the early 1930s.  
                        It proved that African Americans had a rich and vibrant culture which was fast becoming a prominent cultural feature of the United States and the world.  
                        Two leading authors who influenced the movement were W. E. B. DuBois, who wrote The Souls of Black Folk,  and Alain Locke, author of  The New Negro.  
                        William Grant Still was a firm believer and an active participant in the "Harlem Renaissance", and his music showed its influence for the rest of his life.

                        Still became a classical composer while working in the record business.  Black Swan Records was a label owned by African Americans. Still was the director of Black Swan's classical division from 1921-1922, 
                        and was the label's music director from 1922-1924. The first performance of a classical work by Still took place on February 8, 1925.  The ensemble was the International Composer's Guild and the work was From the Land of Dreams.  
                        Still's Darker America was performed in both 1926 and 1927.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Darker America won a publication prize at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and was described as the “high spot” of its New York concert by the Musical Courier, which told its readers that “there is no doubting the man's power.” 
                        The Eastman School of Music and its distinguished director, Dr. Howard Hanson, who would become increasingly important in Still's life. After Darker America, William Grant Still asked the jazz singer Florence Mills if she would sing a work with a 
                        classical orchestra if he were to write one for her.  When she agreed, he wrote Levee Land, with four songs for singer and orchestra.   Eugene Goosens conducted the International Composer's Guild in the premiere of the work on January 4, 1926.  
                        Still and the critics were very pleased, and the audience insisted that the performance be repeated on the spot.

                    <p class="bio-paragraph">
                        Still's successes in 1930 were evidence of his artistic maturity as a composer.  In that year his African ballet Sahdji made use of a scenario by Alain Locke, Arvey relates.  Though the play lasted nearly an hour, the music was composed within a month. Also in that same year, 
                        Still composed the Afro-American Symphony over a 3 month period, during which he had no steady work. In his journal, Still wrote:
                        "I seek in the 'Afro-American Symphony' to portray not the higher type of colored American, but the sons of the soil, who still retain so many of the traits peculiar to their African forebears; who have not responded completely to the transforming effect of progress."
                        Although he had received instruction from (among others) the French modernist composer Edgard Varèse, Still used a traditional tonal idiom in the Afro-American Symphony, infused with blues-inspired melodic lines and harmonic colorings.

                        The first performances of the Afro-American Symphony were given by the Rochester Philharmonic, with Howard Hanson conducting, on Oct. 28 and 29, 1931. Howard Hanson paved the way for others to perform Still’s symphony including the New York Philharmonic’s 
                        premiere of the symphony in 1935 at Carnegie Hall.  Still's symphonic music received its greatest North American publicity when Leopold Stokowski played the fourth movement of the Afro-American Symphony on his cross-country tour with the Philadelphia Orchestra.

                        Still was engaged in writing music for such early films as Lost Horizon (1935), Pennies From Heaven (1936), and Stormy Weather  (1943).  Later he served as composer for television, writing music for Gunsmoke and the original Perry Mason Show  (1954).  
                        All the while, however, he gave serious attention to his symphonic, chamber, and operatic interests. One of the proudest and most historic moments of Still's career took place on July 23, 1936, when he conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in a performance of his own compositions at the Hollywood Bowl. 
                        This was the first time an African American conductor led a major symphony orchestra in concert in the United States.
