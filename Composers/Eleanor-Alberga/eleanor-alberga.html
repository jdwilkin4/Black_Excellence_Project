                        Born in 1949, in Kingston, Jamaica, Eleanor Alberga began her musical career learning the piano at the age of five.  
                        She later gained the only biennial West Indian Associated Board scholarship, which she took up at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she has retained 
                        links as guest lecturer / composer. She spent three years performing with authentic African dance company and has sung with internationally celebrated Jamaican Folk Singers.  
                        She is also a professional  pianist.  Her compositional activity began with writing for London Contemporary Dance Theatre.  
                        This has led to a wide range of concert music encompassing, besides electronic scores, works for orchestra, choral and chamber ensembles, and pieces for solo instruments.

                        Her many commissions encompass a wide range of solo and chamber music as well as orchestral works. Mythologies was premiered in June 2000 with Leonard Slatkin conducting. 
                        Other recent commissions include three String Quartets for the Maggini and Smith Quartets; Dancing with Shadows for Lontano; and Glinting, Glancing Shards for the Delta Saxophone Quartet. 
                        She was invited to participate in the prestigious Composer to Composer Festival in Colorado, USA, and was a featured composer at the Vale of Glamorgan Festival. 
                        Her violin concerto was commissioned by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, and premiered with her husband Thomas Bowes as soloist in November 2001. 
                        The Times commented "It is rare, in etiolated world of contemporary music, for a composer to be called back to the stage three times by an enthusiastic audience after the first performance of a work. 
                        But that was the reception accorded Alberga after the premiere of her new violin concerto." Eleanor Alberga was the first composer to be commissioned for the inaugural Festival of Women in Music.
