                        Florence Beatrice Price was born in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1887. 
                        Her mother worked a variety of jobs while her father was the city’s only black dentist. 
                        At the age of four, Florence played in her first piano recital and by eleven she had her first composition published. 
                        In 1904, Price graduated as high school valedictorian at age 14 and left Little Rock to attend the New England Conservatory.

                        In 1906, Florence earned her Bachelor in Music degree from New England Conservatory. She  was the only one of 2,000 
                        students to complete a double major in organ and piano performance. 
                        Over the next few years, she taught at the Cotton Plant-Arkadelphia Presbyterian Academy and 
                        at Clark University in Atlanta. 
                        In 1912, Florence returned to Little Rock and married Attorney Thomas J. Price.

                        Price struggled to find employment because of mounting racial tensions and segregation.
                        After being refused admission to the all-white Arkansas Music Teachers Association, 
                        she founded the Little Rock Club of Musicians. 
                        As racial tensions began to develop and result in lynchings, 
                        Florence moved with her husband and their two daughters to Chicago in 1927.

                        Around 1928 ,the G. Schirmer and McKinley publishing companies began to publish her music.

                        Even though Price was now a single mother she would later remarry Pusey Dell Arnett.
