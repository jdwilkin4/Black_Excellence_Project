                        Zenobia Perry was born on October 3, 1908 in what was once a predominantly African American town of Boley, Oklahoma. 
                        As a child, Perry met Booker T. Washington and sang for him at his appearance in Boley on August 22, 1915, where he "declared she was a future Tuskegegian." 
                        Perry took piano lessons as a child with Mayme Jones who had been taught by Robert Nathaniel Dett. 
                        In 1919 She won a piano competition. Perry also learned to play violin as a child. 
                        One of her biggest musical influences, however, came from the experience of hearing Hazel Harrison in concert, after which she knew she wanted to study music.

                        In 1925, Perry graduated from Boley High School. 
                        Her father was not supportive of her decision to study music, however her mother allowed Perry to pursue music, sending her to Omaha, Nebraska and studying at the Cecil Berryman Conservatory in 1929.
                        After her return to Boley, Robert Nathaniel Dett visited her family to ask them to send her to the Hampton Institute, where she could study with him.
                        However, soon after, Dett left Hampton for the Eastman School of Music and Perry decided on her own to study privately with Dett in Rochester, New York.
                        Perry studied with Dett until May 1932. In 1935, she went on to study the Tuskegee Institute, and, because of her family's connection with Washington and a promise from Perry to study education as well as music, she was allowed to attend.
                        At Tuskegee she studied with William L. Dawson who encouraged her to compose original work; she was already preparing arrangements for the Tuskegee Institute Chorus.
                        Perry graduated in 1938.

                        During the years of 1949 and until she left UAPB, Perry toured with Kelton Lawrence as a piano duo in order to recruit students for UAPB.
                        From 1955 to 1982, she was a faculty member and composer-in-residence at Central State University, in Wilberforce, Ohio.
