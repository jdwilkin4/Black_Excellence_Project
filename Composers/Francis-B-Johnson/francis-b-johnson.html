                        Francis B. Johnson was a musician, composer, and bandmaster, born in 1792 in Martinique in the West Indies. 
                        Little is known of his early life, but it is believed that he received training from an Irish-keyed bugle soloist by the name of Richard Willis, 
                        who later took on a leadership position at West Point in 1818. 
                        At the age of 17, Johnson had immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and had already mastered the keyed bugle and the violin.  By his early 20s, 
                        he was building a reputation as a bandleader in Philadelphia and southeastern Pennsylvania.

                        Johnson gained greater popularity after music publisher George Willig published his Collection of New Cotillions in 1817. 
                        This was the first instance of a black band leader having his musical compositions published. By 1818, 26-year-old Johnson had become a leading dance band conductor for Philadelphia’s high society.  
                        During the 1820s, Johnson’s band performed at the city’s most popular dance venues at schools, private parties, and balls.  Prominent military regiments like the Washington Guards Company Three Band 
                        and the State First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry also hired Johnson’s ensemble.

                        Although Johnson and his band were quite successful in Philadelphia and throughout the U.S., they sought to expand their audience and their musical knowledge by traveling abroad. In 1837, Johnson made a 
                        public announcement that he and a small portion of his band were planning to travel overseas to Europe. This was the first time ever that African American musicians toured Europe. They also had the pleasure of 
                        playing at the Buckingham Palace, and one of their audience members was Victoria right around the time that she was crowned Queen of England. While in Europe, they also studied different styles, enhanced their music library, 
                        and continued to play concerts. In 1838, they returned during the Christmas holidays. Upon their return, they began giving Promenade concerts fashioned after the French style. Johnson’s band toured throughout the U.S. including Detroit, 
                        Ann Arbor, Louisville, and Cleveland, as well as parts of Canada. Regardless of there renowned success, they were still refused entry into some states, such as Missouri.

                        Although he was extremely successful in the white community, Johnson maintained a presence within the black community as well. He would conduct pieces by Haydn and Handel at local black churches. He showed racial pride when he composed the 
                        “Recognition March on the Independence of Haiti” in response to the Haitian Revolution and “The Grave of the Slave” in response to the abolitionist movement in America. With all his success Johnson could not escape the racial persecution that 
                        permeated within his era. At times all-white bands would refuse to perform in parades that Johnson’s band were invited to. After concerts in Pittsburgh, Johnson’s band was followed by a mob that that threw stones and rocks at his group while shouting racial slurs.

                        During his prolific career, Johnson composed over 200 musical arrangements in various styles including cotillions, operatic airs, ballads, quadrilles, patriotic marches, quicksteps, and other forms of ballroom music.

                        At the end of his life Johnson became very ill and could no longer perform as frequently, but instead he composed more music. Johnson died in 1844, and his funeral was attended by hundreds 
                        of African Americans from the community. His band continued to play even after his death and they named themselves the Frank Johnson String and Brass Band. 
                        The band ended during the American Civil War. To this day, Johnson is recognized by some researchers as the forefather of ragtime and jazz.
