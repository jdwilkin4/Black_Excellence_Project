Black Excellence Project

This site is dedicated to the artists and organizations of the past and present who don't always receive the recognition they deserve.  Florence Price, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and George Walker are just a few of the artists who broke down barriers in the classical music world but are seldomly recognized today.  These men and women deserve to be programmed more often and studied in music schools. 

This site contains # profiles, # educational online games and # links to resources showcasing and celebrating black excellence.
